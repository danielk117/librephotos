# LibrePhotos

Basic documentation for installing and using LibrePhtos.

## Installation

LibrePhotos comes with separate backend and frontend servers. The backend serves the restful API, and the frontend serves, well, the frontend. They are connected via a proxy.
The easiest way to do it is using Docker.

### docker-compose

And the easiest way to install it is using `docker-compose`.

- Download the template and make a copy of it.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/dev/docker-compose.yml.template
cp docker-compose.yml.template docker-compose.yml
```

- Open `docker-compose.yml` in your favorite text editor and make changes in the lines with `# CHANGE ME`.

- Check if you have correctly set `$HOME` variable or replace it with another path.

```
    volumes:
      - $HOME/photos:/data # CHANGE ME
      - $HOME/librephotos_media/:/code/protected_media # CHANGE ME
      - $HOME/librephotos_logs/:/code/logs # CHANGE ME
```

- Set a secret key, deatisl for admin account and an API key for mapbox (geocoding). Sign up at mapbox.com for an free api key.

```
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=changeme # CHANGE ME
      - ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com # CHANGE ME
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=demo # CHANGE ME
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=demo1234 # CHANGE ME
      - MAPBOX_API_KEY=apikey #CHANGE ME
```

- Start pulling images and creating container by executing `docker-compose up -d`.

You should have librephotos accessible after a few minutes of bootup on: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
User is demo, password is demo1234 unless you chaged it in the docker-compose.yml. It is recomended you change the admin username and password if Libre Photos is going to be publicly accessible via the ``docker-compose.yml`` file.

### NAS

If you have a NAS with an Intel or AMD CPU (ARM does not work) and docker running, you can install LibrePhotos on your NAS.
The Docker frontend of Synology or QNAP doesn't allow you to execute `docker-compose`. You could load the images and create containers manually. The docker-compose.yml contains all the necessary details for creating it.

Some NAS has `doker-compose` installed (like Synology or QNAP) or you are able to install it download binary and place it at the docker binaries. 
However, root and SSH are required for this. The following example shows the installation on a Synology NAS.

- Access your NAS using SSH and check if `docker-compose` is available. For Synology execute `sudo docker-composem-g`.
- Create a directory, for example in your home directory like `/var/services/homes/admin/librephotos`.
- Follow the instructions from above. Start `docker-compose up -d` with `sudo`.
- Yout should be albe now to connect the port 3000.

## Setup

LibrePhotos is now successfully installed and we finally want to have our photos scanned.

### Getting started

You need to log in as the admin user, and set up the directory for the users. To do this, click the top right button, and go to "Admin Area". On this page, it will show a list of users, and manually set the "Scan Directory" for the desired user. Only an admin can do this. And then you can go to Dashboard - Library and click the Green "Scan photos (file system)" button. If you have a Nextcloud instance, you can also input this in the Dashboard-Library page. Once logged in (the little circle next to "Nextcloud Scan Directory will be green), you can choose a top level directory in your logged in Nextcloud account. Once this works, you can click the blue "Scan photos (Nextcloud)". The backend system will copy the contents of the Nextcloud directory you specified.

#### File system

- For scaning photos that reside in the local file system
- Only the admin user can change the "scan directory" of the users, including the admin itself.
- Normal users cannot change his/her own "scan directory"
- Only the admin can find the page to control this under the "user icon (top right) - admin area"
        
#### Nextcloud
        
- For scaning photos that reside in external Nextcloud instances
- Any user can change his/her own Nextcloud endpoint, and choose a top level directory in the Nextcloud account.

### Face recognition

After the first scan, you should see some faces under *Dashboard > Face recognition*.

#### Create People

Select a few faces from one person, click *+* in the right corner.
Enter a name for your people.

#### Inferred Faces

Under *Dashboard > Library* you can execute *train faces*
